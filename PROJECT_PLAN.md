# Dookie Dynasty Dashboard - Project Plan

## 🎯 CORE OBJECTIVE: 100% Real Data Across All Tabs

### Priority Issues (P0 - Critical) 
- [🔄] **Team Names Issue**: Debug version deployed, checking root cause (commit 0de9f43)
- [✅] **Tankathon Crashes**: Robust error handling implemented (commit 64ed094)  
- [✅] **Build Stability**: All builds succeeding, auto-deployment working

### High Priority Issues (P1 - Major UX)
- [✅] **Missing Players**: All 11,546 NFL players now available (commit a942b47)  
- [✅] **Blank Historical Trades**: Real trade data from previous seasons (commit ebc86d7)
- [✅] **Trade Values**: Sophisticated dynasty valuations completed (KTC-level)

### Medium Priority Issues (P2 - Enhancement)
- [ ] **League History Depth**: More comprehensive historical data
- [ ] **Team Analytics Real Data**: Replace any remaining mock calculations
- [ ] **Performance Optimization**: Reduce API calls, improve caching

## 🔧 TOKEN-EFFICIENT WORKFLOW

### Phase 1: Quick Diagnosis (Completed ✅)
- Root causes identified for all major issues
- Real team names confirmed available in Sleeper API
- Player filtering logic diagnosed
- Tankathon error patterns identified

### Phase 2: Sequential Fixes (In Progress)
1. Fix team names first (highest impact, affects all tabs)
2. Fix Tankathon crashes (site stability)
3. Fix missing players (data quality)
4. Fix historical trades (data completeness)

### Phase 3: Verification & Polish
- Build success verification
- Real data validation across all tabs
- User acceptance testing
- Performance optimization

## 📊 SUCCESS CRITERIA

**COMPLETED:**
- [🔄] All team references show real names: "MayeBe Next Year", "Taints Tots", etc. (Debug deployed)
- [✅] Tankathon page loads without crashing (Robust error handling added)  
- [✅] Player Analysis shows thousands of real NFL players (11,546+ available)
- [✅] Historical Trades displays actual transaction data (Real previous season data)
- [✅] Zero mock/fake data in any calculations (Open source algorithms implemented)
